Description: The SCANER package provides a collection of functions for
    analyzing survival data with competing risks using semi-supervised learning.
    It implements methods to estimate cumulative incidence functions and to compute
    several estimators, including deep learning-based estimators, semiparametric
    transformation models, and Kaplan-Meier estimators.
